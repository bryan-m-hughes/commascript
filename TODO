Make API definition mechanism very generic, and use for built-in types
* Built-in prototype functions and properties should use this, e.g. "number" will have an API definition
* Types are now generic strings in a lookup table, that is pre-populated with primitives
* Objects, functions, and arrays will require an inheritence-based mechanism
* So yeah, along those lines, implement support for inheritence

Add mechanisms for defining API interface, but leaving interior untyped
* Should be separate file
* Necessary for using libraries not written in commascript
* Tool to create it from JSDoc

Create macro/preprocess/loader/whatever construct
* CommonJS and RequireJS, where return value varies, type system instrospects a little further

Compilation Phase
* Validates code
* Strips out type annotations (do minifiers already do this?), OR:
* Sends it through LLVM connected to asm.js/emscripten

Integrate with other products
* Custom/forked version of RequireJS that runs compilation before evaling script
	* Ability to enable/disable?
